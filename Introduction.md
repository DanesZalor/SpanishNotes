# introduction

When telling someone *to do* something, the pronoun joins the end of the verb;

|  | |
|--|--|
| Ayúda**me** | Help me |
| Acompáña**nos** | Come with us |

> just like in any language, ther are certain pitfalls which we have to avoid.

 
```
Tip
    remember to use personal **a**  before
    indefinite pronouns referring to people
    when they are the object of a verb

    ¿Viste a alguien?   Did you see anybody?
    No vi a nadie.      I didn't see anybody.
```
