# Nouns
a **noun** is a naming word for a living being, thing, or idea. for example: *woman, desk, happiness, Garfield*.

### using nouns
In spanish, all nouns are either *masculine* or *feminine*. Even The *"gender"* of words affect the form of other words use with it such as the adjectives and articles.
- **el** or **un** if masculine
- **la** or **una** if feminine
> though there are exceptions to these rules.

|--|--|
| *el* hombre | the man   |
| *el* rey    | the king  |
| *la* mujer  | the woman |
| *la* reina  | the queen |

However, the appropriate article to be used with a noun changes depending on the context.

| | |
|--|--|
| el estudiante | the student<sup>♂</sup> | 
| la estudiante | the student<sup>♀</sup> |

Some words for people have only **one** possible gender, regardless if they refer to a male or female.

|-|-|
| la persona | the person<sup>⚥</sup> |
| la victima | the victim<sup>⚥</sup> |

In english, we can sometimes make a word masculine or feminine by changing the ending (like prince or princess). In spanish, very often, the ending of a noun changes depending on whether the context is noun to a man or a woman.

| *el* camarero | the waiter |
| *la* camarera | the waitress |
| el empleado | the employee<sup>♂</sup>
| la empleada | the employee<sup>♀</sup>

Just like in english, spanish sometimes separate words for mae and female animals

| *el* toro | the bull |
| *la* vaca | the cow |
| *el* perro | the dog<sup>♂</sup> |
| *la* perra | the dog<sup>♀</sup>, bitch |
| *el* gato | the cat<sup>♂</sup> |
| *la* gata | the cat<sup>♀</sup> | 

> when you don't know or care what the sex o an animal is, you can usually use the masculine form as a general word

However, for some animals, their spanish word does not change
