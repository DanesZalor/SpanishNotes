is one of the words *the*, *a*, and *an* which is given in front of a noun

### types of article
- **definite article** - is used to identify a particular subject.
    - I'm going to *the* supermarket.
    - That's the woman I was talking to.
- **indefinite article** - refer to an unspecified subject.
    - Is there *a* hospital near here?
    - I need *an* examination for my testicles.

### definite article: *el, la, los* and *las*

Unlike in English that only has one article "*the*", Spanish has 4 articles: *el, la, los* and *las*. It depends on the noun that follows.

##### Singular article (el<sup>♂</sup> la<sup>♀</sup>)
| | |
|-|-|
| el niño | the boy |
| el periódico | the newspapaer |
| la niña | the girl | 
| la revista | the magazine |

##### Plural article (los<sup>♂</sup> las<sup>♀</sup>)
| | |
|-|-|
| los niños | the boys |
| las niñas | the girls |
| los periódicos | the newspapers |
| las revistas | the magazines | 

but you use **el** instead of **la** before a feminine singular word if it begins with **a** or **ha**. This is because **la** sounds wrong before the *'a'* sound.
