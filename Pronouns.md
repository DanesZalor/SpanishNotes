# Pronoun
is a word you use instead of a noun such as *I*, *he*, *she*, *they*, etc. Pronouns stand in for nouns when it the subject is specified.
Example: *"My brother isn't here at the moment. **He**'ll be back in an hour."*

| Singular | | Plural | |
|-|-|-|-|
| yo | I | nosotros<br>nosotras | we<sup>♂</sup><br>we<sup>♀</sup>| 
| tú | you | vosotros<br>vosotras | you<sup>♂</sup><br>you<sup>♀</sup> |
| él<br>ella | he<br>she | ellos<br>ellas | they<sup>♂</sup><br>they<sup>♀</sup> |
| usted (Vd.) | you | ustedes (Vds.) | you |

> **tú** (you) and **él** (he) has an accent, not to be confused with **tu** (your) and **el** (the).

> Use **usted** when addressing people with respect, or formality. **tú** when addressing someone casually or intimately.

> **Vd.** and **Vds.** are abbreviations often used instead of **usted** and **ustedes**

In English, we use subject pronouns all the time when using verbs - *__I__ walk, __you__ eat, __they__ are going.*
In Spanish however, we don't need them, instead the verb endings provide context who the subject is.
